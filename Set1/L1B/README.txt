6.  Using a terminal, perform the following steps.  List the commands used to perform the tasks:

- print the current directory you are in when the terminal opens
pwd

- move into the lab1b_folder directory
cd /Users/brandonching/Documents/GitHub/CSCI261/Set1/L1B

- list the contents of the directory
ls

- move into the data directory
cd data

- rename the misspelled file fil2.txt to be file2.txt
mv fil2.txt file2.txt

- copy file1.txt to be file3.txt
cp file1.txt file3.txt

- make a new file named file4.txt
touch file4.txt

- move to the parent directory
cd ..

- make a directory named bin
mkdir bin

- compile main.cpp into an executable
g++ main.cpp

- move the generated executable into the bin folder and rename it to be lab1b
mv a.out bin/lab1b.out

- print the current directory you are currently in
pwd

- run the new executable from your current directory
./bin/lab1b.out
